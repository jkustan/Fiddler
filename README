== Welcome to Fiddler

Fiddler consists of a single class that can compute sunrise & sunset for an arbitrary latitude, longitude, date, and time zone.  It is a port of a javascript set of functions from http://www.csgnetwork.com/sunriseset.html, but hopefully having it in objective C will save you some time.
